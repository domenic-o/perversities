\subsection{The (he)art of gluing} The slice functor hides greater potential. Indeed, even if we don't have a morphism of $\mathbb{Z}$-posets (but just a $\mathbb{Z}$-equivariant map), then the slice functor can still be applied, obtaining a partially defined map. \\

Let $J$ be a $\Z$-toset, i.e., a totally ordered set together with a monotone action of $\Z$, that we will denote by $(n,x)\mapsto x+n$. Recall that a $J$-slicing on a stable $\infty$-category $\mathscr{D}$ is a morphism of $\Z$-posests $\tee\colon \Oo(J)\to \ts(\mathscr{D})$, where $\Oo(J)$ is the $\Z$-poset of the slicings of $J$ (i.e., the decompositions of $J$ into a disjoint union of a lower set $L$ and of an upper set $U$), and $\ts(\mathscr{D})$ is the $\Z$-poset of $t$-structures on $\mathscr{D}$.

Clearly, if $f\colon J\to J'$ is a morphism of $\Z$-tosets, then $f^{-1}\colon \{\text{subsets of $J'$}\}\to \{\text{subsets of $J$}\}$ induces a $\Z$-equivariant morphism of $\Z$-posets $f^{-1}\colon \Oo(J')\to \Oo(J)$, and so composition with $f^{-1}$ gives a morphism
\begin{align*}
f_*\colon J\text{-slicings on $\mathscr{D}$}&\to J'\text{-slicings on $\mathscr{D}$}\\
\tee&\mapsto \tee\circ f^{-1}.
\end{align*}
The slices of $f_*\tee$ are clearly given by $\mathscr{D}_{f_*\tee;\phi}=\mathscr{D}_{\tee;f^{-1}(\{\phi\})}$. Notice that, as $f$ is monotone, the subset $f^{-1}(\{\phi\})$ is an interval in $J$. It is immediate to see that $f_*$ restricts to a map
\begin{align*}
f_*\colon \text{Bridgeland $J$-slicings on $\mathscr{D}$}&\to \text{Bridgeland $J'$-slicings on $\mathscr{D}$}
\end{align*}
Namely, if $\mathcal{H}^\phi_{f_*\tee}(X)=0$ for every $\phi\in J'$ then $\mathcal{H}^{f^{-1}(\{\phi\})}_{\tee}(X)=0$ for every $\phi$ in $J'$. As we are assuming the $J$-slicing $\tee$ is a Bridgeland slicing, this implies that $\mathcal{H}^{\psi}_{\tee}(X)=0$ for every $\psi$ in $f^{-1}(\{\phi\})$, for every $\phi$. Therefore $\mathcal{H}^{\psi}_{\tee}(X)=0$ for every $\psi$ in $J$ and so, again by definition of Bridgeland slicing, $X=0$. Also, if $\mathcal{H}^\phi_{f_*\tee}(X)\neq 0$ then $\mathcal{H}^{f^{-1}(\{\phi\})}_{\tee}(X)\neq 0$ and so (again by the Bridgeland slicing condition) there exists at least an element $\psi$ in $f^{-1}(\{\phi\})$ such that $\mathcal{H}^{\psi}_{\tee}(X)\neq 0$. As the $J$-slicing $\tee$ is Bridgeland, the total of these $\psi$'s must be finite, so only for finitely many $\phi$ we can have such a $\psi$. In other words, the number of indices $\phi$ in $J'$ such that $\mathcal{H}^\phi_{f_*\tee}(X)\neq 0$ is finite.

Notice that, if $\tee$ is a Bridgeland slicing of $\mathscr{D}$, and $f\colon J\to J'$ is a morphism of $\Z$-tosets, then for any slicing $(L,U)$ of $J'$, the lower and the upper categories
$\mathscr{D}_{f_*\tee(L)}$ and $\mathscr{D}_{f_*\tee(U)}$ can be equivalently defined as
\begin{align*}
\mathscr{D}_{f_*\tee(L)}&=\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in L}\\
\mathscr{D}_{f_*\tee(U)}&=\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in U}
\end{align*}
where $\langle \mathscr{S}\rangle$ denotes the extension-closed subcategory of $\mathscr{D}$ generated by the subcategory $\mathscr{S}$.\footnote{
At some point it will be useful to recall Lemma 4.21 from ??:
Let $\mathscr{S}_1,\mathscr{S}_2$ be two subcategories of $\mathscr{D}$ with $\mathscr{S}_1\orth \mathscr{S}_2$, i.e., such that $\mathscr{D}(X_1,X_2)$ is contractible for any $X_1\in \mathscr{S}_1$ and any $X_2\in\mathscr{S}_2$. Then $\mathscr{S}_1\orth \langle\mathscr{S}_2\rangle$ and $\langle\mathscr{S}_1\rangle\orth \mathscr{S}_2$, and so $\langle\mathscr{S}_1\rangle\orth \langle\mathscr{S}_2\rangle$.}

The right hand sides of the above two expressions can clearly be defined for every morphism $f$ from $J$ to $J'$ (i.e., not necessarily monotone nor $\Z$-equivariant), and as soon as $f$ is $\Z$-equivariant, the assignment
\[
(L,U)\mapsto (\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in L},\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in U})
\]
is an equivariant morphism from $\mathcal{O}(J)$ to pairs of subcategories of $\mathscr{D}$. Clearly, when $f$ is not monotone there is no reason to expect that the pair $(\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in L},\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in U})$ forms a $t$-structure on $\mathscr{D}$. Yet, it interesting to notice that the condition that $f$ be monotone is only only sufficient in order to have this, and can indeed be relaxed.

\begin{defn}\label{compatible}
Let $J$ and $J'$ be $\Z$-tosets, and let $f\colon J\to J'$ a map of $\Z$-sets (i.e., a $\Z$-equivariant map, not necessarily nondecreasing). A Bridgeland $J$-slicing $\tee$ of $\mathscr{D}$ is \emph{$f$-compatible}
if $f(\phi)>f(\psi)$ with $\phi\leq \psi$ implies $\mathscr{D}_{\tee; \phi}\orth \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\psi}$ and $\mathscr{D}_{\tee; \phi}\orth \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\psi}[1]$
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
Clearly, if $f$ is monotone, then every $J$-slicing $\tee$ is $f$-compatible as the condition `$f(\phi)>f(\psi)$ with $\phi\leq \psi$' is empty.
\end{rem}

\begin{lem}\label{is-t-structure}
Let $J$ and $J'$ be $\Z$-tosets, and let $f\colon J\to J'$ be a $\Z$-equivariant morphism of $\Z$-sets (i.e., not necessarily a monotone map) and let $\tee$ be a Bridgeland slicing of $\mathscr{D}$ which is $f$-compatible. Then, for any slicing $(L,U)$ of $J'$, the pair of subcategories
$(\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in L},\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in U})$ is a $t$-structure on $\mathscr{D}$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
As $f$ is $\Z$-equivariant and $U+1\subseteq U$, we have
\begin{align*}
\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in U}[1]&=\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}[1]\rangle_{f(\phi)\in U}\\
&=\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi+1}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in U}\\
&=\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi+1}\rangle_{f(\phi+1)\in U+1}\\
&=\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in U+1}\\
&\subseteq \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in U}
\end{align*}
and similarly for the lower subcategory $\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in L}$. To show that 
\[
\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in U}\orth \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in L}
\]
it suffices to show that, if $f(\psi)\in L$ and $f(\phi)\in U$ then $\mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\orth \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\psi}$. As $L\cap U=\emptyset$ we cannot have $\psi=\phi$, so either $\psi<\phi$ or vice versa. In the first case, $\mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\orth \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\psi}$ by definition of Bridgeland $J$-slicing. In the second case, we have $\phi<\psi$ and $f(\phi)>f(\psi)$ as $f(\phi)\in U$ and  $f(\psi)\in L$. Therefore, since $\tee$ is $f$-compatible, $\mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\orth\mathscr{D}_{\tee;\psi}$. Finally, we have to show that every object $X$ in $\mathscr{D}$ fits into a fiber sequence
\[
\xymatrix{
X_U\ar[r]\ar[d] & X\ar[d]\\
0\ar[r] & X_L
}
\]
with $X_L\in \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in L}$ and $X_U\in \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in U}$. As $\tee$ is a Bridgeland slicing, we have a factorization of the initial morphism $\mathbf{0} \to X$ of the form
\[
\mathbf{0}=X_0 \xrightarrow{\alpha_1} X_1\cdots \xrightarrow{\alpha_{{\bar\imath}}}X_{{\bar\imath}}\xrightarrow{\alpha_{{\bar\imath}+1}}X_{{\bar\imath}+1}\xrightarrow{}\cdots \xrightarrow{\alpha_n} X_n=X
\]
with $\mathbf{0} \neq \cofib(\alpha_i)=\mathcal{H}_{\tee}^{\phi_i}(X) \in \mathscr{D}_{\phi_i}$ for all $i = 1, \cdots, n$, with $\phi_i>\phi_{i+1}$. Let us now consider the sequence of symbols $L$ and $U$ obtained putting in the $i$-th place $L$ if $f(\phi_i)\in L$ and $U$ if $f(\phi_i)\in U$. If this sequence is of the form $(U,U,\dots,U,L,L,\dots,L)$, then there exists an index $\bar{\imath}$ such that
 $f(\phi_{i})\in U$ for $i\leq \bar{\imath}$ and $f(\phi_{i})\in L$ for $i>\bar{\imath}$ (with ${\bar\imath}=-1$ or $n$ when all of the $f(\phi_i)$ are in $L$ or in $U$, respectively). Then we can
consider the pullout diagram
\[
\xymatrix{
X_{{\bar\imath}}\ar[r]\ar[d]_{f_{L}}&0\ar[d]\\
X\ar[r]&\mathrm{cofib}(f_{L})
}\]
together with the factorizations
\[
\mathbf{0}=X_0 \xrightarrow{\alpha_1} X_1\cdots \xrightarrow{\alpha_{{\bar\imath}}}X_{{\bar\imath}} 
\]
and
\[
X_{{\bar\imath}}\xrightarrow{\alpha_{{\bar\imath}+1}}X_{{\bar\imath}+1}\xrightarrow{}\cdots \xrightarrow{\alpha_n} X_n=X.
\]
The first factorization shows that $X_{{\bar\imath}}\in \langle\cup_{i=0}^{{\bar\imath}}\mathscr{D}_{\phi_i}\rangle\subseteq \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in U}$ while the second factorization shows that $\mathrm{cofib}(f_{L})\in  \langle\cup_{i={\bar\imath}+1}^n\mathscr{D}_{\phi_i}\rangle\subseteq \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in L}$. So we are done in this case. Therefore, we are reduced to showing that we can always avoid a $(\dots,L,U,\dots)$ situation in our sequence of $L$'s and $U$'s. Assume we have such a situation. Then we have an index $i_0$ with $f(\phi_{i_0})\in L$ and $f(\phi_{{i_0}+1})\in U$. This in particular implies $f(\phi_{{i_0}+1})>f(\phi_{i_0})$ with $\phi_{{i_0}+1}<\phi_{i_0}$. As $\tee$ is $f$-compatible, this gives $\mathscr{D}_{\tee; \phi_{i_0+1}}\orth (\mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi_{i_0}}[1])$. In particular, $\mathscr{D}(\mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0+1}}_{\tee}(X),\mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0}}_{\tee}(X)[1])$ is contractible. Now consider the pasting of pullout diagrams
\[
\xymatrix{X_{i_0-1}\ar[r]^{\alpha_{i_0}}\ar[d] & X_{i_0}\ar[r]^{\alpha_{i_0+1}}\ar[d] & X_{i_0+1}\ar[d]^{\gamma}\\
0\ar[r]&\mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0}}_{\tee}(X)\ar[d]\ar[r]&Y\ar[d]\ar[r] &0\ar[d]\\
&0\ar[r]&\mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0+1}}_{\tee}(X)\ar[r]&\mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0}}_{\tee}(X)[1].
}
\]
As the arrow $\mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0+1}}_{\tee}(X)\to \mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0}}_{\tee}(X)[1]$ factors through $0$, we have $Y=\mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0+1}}_{\tee}(X)\oplus \mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0}}_{\tee}(X)$ and the above diagram becomes
\[
\xymatrix{X_{i_0-1}\ar[r]^{\alpha_{i_0}}\ar[d] & X_{i_0}\ar[r]^{\alpha_{i_0+1}}\ar[d] & X_{i_0+1}\ar[d]^{\gamma}\\
0\ar[r]&\mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0}}_{\tee}(X)\ar[d]\ar[r]^-{\iota_2}&\mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0+1}}_{\tee}(X)\oplus \mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0}}_{\tee}(X)\ar[d]^{\pi_1}\ar[r] &0\ar[d]\\
&0\ar[r]&\mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0+1}}_{\tee}(X)\ar[r]&\mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0}}_{\tee}(X)[1],
}
\]
where $\iota_2$ and $\pi_1$ are the canonical inclusion and projection. Let $\beta\colon X_{i_0+1}\to \mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0}}_{\tee}(X)$ be the composition
\[
\beta\colon X_{i_0+1}\xrightarrow{\gamma} \mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0+1}}_{\tee}(X)\oplus \mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0}}_{\tee}(X)\xrightarrow{\pi_2} 
\mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0}}_{\tee}(X).
\]
Then we have a homotopy commutative diagram
\[
\xymatrix{
X_{i_0-1}\ar[r]^{\alpha_{i_0}}\ar[d]&X_{i_0}\ar[r]^{\alpha_{i_0+1}}\ar[d] & X_{i_0+1}\ar[d]^{\beta}\\
0\ar[r]&\mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0}}_{\tee}(X)\ar[r]^-{\mathrm{id}}&\mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0}}_{\tee}(X)
}
\]
(where only the left square is a pullout), and so the composition $\alpha_{i_0+1}\circ \alpha_{i_0}$ factors through the homotopy fiber of $\beta$. In other words, we have a homotopy commutative diagram
\[
\xymatrix{
X_{i_0-1}\ar[r]^{\alpha_{i_0}}\ar[d]_{\tilde{\alpha}_{i_0}}&X_{i_0}\ar[d]^{\alpha_{i_0+1}}\\
\fib(\beta)\ar[r]^{\tilde{\alpha}_{i_0+1}}&X_{i_0+1}\
}
\]
Writing $\tilde{X}_{i_0}=\fib(\beta)$, we get the pasting of pullout diagrams
\[
\xymatrix{X_{i_0-1}\ar[r]^{\tilde{\alpha}_{i_0}}\ar[d] & \tilde{X}_{i_0}\ar[r]^{\tilde{\alpha}_{i_0+1}}\ar[d] & X_{i_0+1}\ar[d]^{\gamma}\\
0\ar[r]&\mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0+1}}_{\tee}(X)\ar[d]\ar[r]^-{\iota_1}&\mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0+1}}_{\tee}(X)\oplus \mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0}}_{\tee}(X)\ar[d]_{\pi_2}\\
&0\ar[r]&\mathcal{H}^{\phi_{i_0}}_{\tee}(X).
}
\]
That is, by considering the factorization $X_{i_0-1}\xrightarrow{\tilde{\alpha}_{i_0}} \tilde{X}_{i_0}\xrightarrow{\tilde{\alpha}_{i_0+1}} X_{i_0+1}$ we have switched the cofibers with respect to the original factorization $X_{i_0-1}\xrightarrow{{\alpha}_{i_0}} {X}_{i_0}\xrightarrow{{\alpha}_{i_0+1}} X_{i_0+1}$. Therefore, writing $\tilde{\phi}_{i_0}=\phi_{i_0+1}$ and $\tilde{\phi}_{i_0+1}=\phi_{i_0}$, 
we now have  $f(\tilde{\phi}_{i_0})\in U$ and $f(\tilde{\phi}_{i_0+1})\in L$. That is, we have removed the $(\dots,L,U,\dots)$ situation from the position $i_0$, replacing it with a $(\dots,U,L,\dots)$ situation, while keeping all the labels $L,U$ before this positions unchanged. Repeating the procedure the needed number of times, we eventually get rid of all the $(\dots,L,U,\dots)$ situations.\footnote{This is somehow reminiscent of the `bubble sort' algorithm.}
\end{proof}

\begin{rem}\label{a-closer-look}
It follows from the proof of Lemma \ref{is-t-structure} that the objects $X_L$ and $X_U$ in the fiber sequence $X_U\to X\to X_L$ associated with the $t$-struture $(\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in L},\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in U})$ on $\mathscr{D}$ satisfy
\begin{align*}
X_L&\in \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi};\quad f(\phi)\in L \text{ and }\mathcal{H}^\phi_\tee(X)\neq 0\rangle\\
X_U&\in \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi};\quad f(\phi)\in U \text{ and }\mathcal{H}^\phi_\tee(X)\neq 0\rangle
\end{align*}
\end{rem}

\begin{lem}\label{slices}
For any $j\in J'$ we have
\[
\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)=j}=\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\leq j}\cap \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\geq j}.
\]
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Clearly, $\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)=j}\subseteq \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\leq j}\cap \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\geq j}$, therefore we only need to prove the converse inclusion. Let $\in \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\leq j}\cap \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\geq j}$. Then in particular 
$X\in \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\geq j}$
and so there exists a factorization of the initial morphism $\mathbf{0} \to X$ of the form
\[
\mathbf{0}=X_0 \xrightarrow{\alpha_1} X_1\xrightarrow{\alpha_2}\cdots \xrightarrow{\alpha_{n-1}}X_{n-1}\xrightarrow{\alpha_n} X_n=X
\]
with $\mathbf{0} \neq \cofib(\alpha_i) \in \mathscr{D}_{\phi_i}$ with $f(\phi_i)\geq i$ for all $i = 1, \cdots, n$. As $((-\infty,j],(j,+\infty)$ is a slicing of $J'$, reasoning as in the proof of Lemma \ref{is-t-structure} we can arrange this factorization is such a way that $f(\phi_i)>j$ for $i\leq \bar{\imath}$ and $f(\phi_i)= j$ for $i>\bar{\imath}$. Therefore, again by reasoning as in the proof of Lemma \ref{is-t-structure} we get a fiber sequence of the form
\[
\xymatrix{
X_{>j}\ar[r]\ar[d] & X\ar[d]\\
0\ar[r]&X_{j}
}
\]
with $X_{>j}$ in $\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)>j}$ and $X_j$ in $\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)=j}$. This is in particular a fiber sequence of the form $X_{>j}\to X\to X_{\leq j}$, with $X_{\leq j}\in \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\leq j}$. 
As $(\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\leq j},\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)> j})$ is a $t$-structure on $\mathscr{D}$ by Lemma \ref{is-t-structure}, there is (up to equivalence) only one such a fiber sequence. And since $X\in \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\leq j}$, this is the sequence $0\to X\xrightarrow{\mathrm{id}} X$. Therefore $X=X_j$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}
Let $f\colon J\to J'$ be a $\Z$-equivariant morphism of $\Z$-sets (i.e., not necessarily a monotone map) and let $\tee$ be a Bridgeland slicing of $\mathscr{D}$ which is $f$-compatible.  The map
\begin{align*}
f_!\tee\colon \Oo(J')&\to\ts(\mathscr{D})\\
(L,U)&\mapsto (\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in L},\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)\in U})
\end{align*}
defined by Lemma \ref{is-t-structure} is a Bridgeland $J'$-slicing of $\mathscr{D}$, with slices given by
\[
\mathscr{D}_{f_!\tee;j}=\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)=j}.
\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
The map $f_!\tee$ is manifestly monotone and $\Z$-equivariant (see the first part of the proof of Lemma \ref{is-t-structure}), so it is a $J'$ slicing of $\mathscr{D}$, and its slices are given by $\mathscr{D}_{f_!\tee;j}=
%\mathscr{D}_{f_!\tee;\geq j}\cap \mathscr{D}_{f_!\tee;\leq j},
%\]
%and so by the subcategories $
\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi}\rangle_{f(\phi)=j}$ by Lemma \ref{slices}. We are therefore left with showing that it is finite and discrete. Given an object $X$ in $\mathscr{D}$, let now $\{\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n\}$ be the indices in $J$ such that $\mathcal{H}^{\phi_i}_\tee(X)\neq 0$ and let $\{j_1,\dots,j_k\}$ the image of the set $\{\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n\}$ via $f$. Up to renaming, we can assume $j_1>j_{2}>\cdots>j_k$. Consider now the factorization
\[
\mathbf{0}=X_0 \xrightarrow{\alpha_1} X_1\xrightarrow{\alpha_2}\cdots \xrightarrow{\alpha_{k-1}}X_{k-1}\xrightarrow{\alpha_k} X_k=X
\]
of the initial morphism of $X$ associated to the decreasing sequence $j_1>j_2>\cdots>j_k$ by the $J'$-slicing $f_!\tee$. The cofibers of the morphisms $\alpha_{i}$ are the cohomologies
$\mathcal{H}^{(j_{i+1},j_{i}]}_{f_!\tee}(X)$ and, by Remark \ref{a-closer-look}, we have
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{H}^{(j_{i+1},j_{i}]}_{f_!\tee}(X)\in& \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi};\quad f(\phi)\in (j_{i+1},j_{i}] \text{ and }\mathcal{H}^\phi_\tee(X)\neq 0\rangle\\
&=\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi};\quad \phi\in\{\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n\}\text{ and } f(\phi)\in(j_{i+1},j_{i}]\rangle\\
&=\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi};\quad \phi\in\{\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n\}\text{ and } f(\phi)=j_{i}\rangle\\
&\subseteq \langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi};\quad  f(\phi)=j_{i}\rangle=\mathscr{D}_{f_!\tee;j_{i}}.
\end{align*}
Therefore
\[
\mathcal{H}^{(j_i,j_{i-1}]}_{f_!\tee}(X)=\mathcal{H}^{j_i}_{f_!\tee}\mathcal{H}^{(j_i,j_{i-1}]}_{f_!\tee}(X)=\mathcal{H}^{j_i}_{f_!\tee}(X).
\]
This tells us that, if all the cohomologies $\mathcal{H}^{j}_{f_!\tee}(X)$ vanish, then also all the $\mathcal{H}^{(j_i,j_{i-1}]}_{f_!\tee}(X)$ vanish, and so $X=0$. Finally, if $\tilde{j}\notin\{j_1,\dots,j_k\}$, then there exists an index $i$ such that $j_{i+1}<\tilde{j}<j_{i}$ and so $(j_{i+1},\tilde{j}]\cap \{j_1,\dots,j_k\}=\emptyset$. The above argument then shows that
\[
\mathcal{H}^{(j_{i+1},\tilde{j}]}_{f_!\tee}(X)\in\langle \mathscr{D}_{\tee;\phi};\quad \phi\in\{\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n\}\text{ and } f(\phi)\in(j_{i+1},\tilde{j}]\rangle=\{\mathbf{0}\}.
\]
It follows that 
\[
\mathcal{H}^{\tilde{j}}_{f_!\tee}(X)=\mathcal{H}^{\tilde{j}}_{f_!\tee}\mathcal{H}^{(j_{i+1},\tilde{j}]}_{f_!\tee}(X)=\mathcal{H}^{\tilde{j}}_{f_!\tee}(0)=0,
\]
for every $\tilde{j}\notin \{j_1,\dots,j_k\}$. So in particular, for any $X\in \mathscr{D}$, the cohomologies $\mathcal{H}^{j}_{f_!\tee}(X)$ are possibly nonzero only for finitely many indices $j$. 
\end{proof}


Let now $J_1$ and $J_2$ be two $\mathbb{Z}$-tosets, and let $J_1 \lex J_2$ and $J_2 \lex J_1$ the two $\Z$-tosets obtained by considering the lexicogaphic order on the products $J_1\times J_2$ and $J_2\times J_1$, respectively, and the diagonal $\Z$ action. The following lemma is immediate.
\begin{lem}
The exchange map
\begin{align*}
e\colon J_1\times J_2&\to J_2\times J_1\\
(j_1,j_2)&\mapsto (j_2,j_1)
\end{align*}
is $\Z$-equivariant.
\end{lem}

\begin{defn}\label{gluable}
Let $J_1$ and $J_2$ be $\Z$-tosets. A Bridgeland $J_1 \lex J_2$-slicing $\tee$ of $\mathscr{D}$ is said to be \emph{gluable} if it is $e$-compatible, where $e \colon J_1 \times J_2 \to J_2 \times J_1$ is the exchange map. 
\end{defn}

\begin{exmp} Let $J_1=\{0,1\}$ with the trivial $\Z$-action and let $J_2=\Z$ with the standard translation $\Z$-action.  Then a $J_1\lex J_2$-slicing $\tee$ on $\mathscr{D}$ is the datum of a semiorthogonal decomposition $(\mathscr{D}_0,\mathscr{D}_1)$ of $\mathscr{D}$ toghether with $t$-structures $\tee_i$ on $\mathscr{D}_i$. Spelling out the definiton, one sees that the $\{0,1\}\lex \Z$-slicing $\tee$ is gluable if and only if 
$\mathscr{D}_{0;\geq 0}\orth \mathscr{D}_{1;-1}$ and $\mathscr{D}_{0;\geq 0}\orth \mathscr{D}_{1;0}$. When this happens, the glued slicing $e_!\tee$ is a $\Z\lex\{0,1\}$ slicing on $\mathscr{D}$, i.e., is the datum of a bounded $t$-structure on $\mathscr{D}$ together with a torsion theory on its heart. More precisely, the heart of $e_!\tee$ is the full $\infty$-subcategory $\mathscr{D}^{\heartsuit_{e_!\tee}}$ of $\mathscr{D}$ on thise objects $X$ that fall into fiber sequences of the form $X_1\to X\to X_0$ with $X_i\in \mathscr{D}_i^\heartsuit$, while the torsion theory on $\mathscr{D}^{\heartsuit_{e_!\tee}}$ is
$(\mathscr{D}_0^{\heartsuit},\mathscr{D}_1^{\heartsuit})$, i.e., precisely the pair of hearts of the two subcategories in the semiorthogonal decomposition.
\end{exmp}


\begin{defn}
Let $U\colon J \to \Oo(J')$ be a map of sets. We denote by $\gr_{U}$ the subset of $J\times J'$ defined by 
 $$\gr_U=\{ (j,j') \in J \times J'; \quad j' \in U_{j} \}.$$
 For $f\colon J\to J'$ a map of sets, we denote by $(<f,\geq f)\colon J \to \Oo(J')$ the composition of $f$ with the map
 \begin{align*}
 J'&\to \Oo(J')\\
 j'&\mapsto ((-\infty,j'),[j',+\infty)).
 \end{align*}
 The upper graphic of $f$ is the subset $\gr_{\geq f}$ of $J\times J'$.
\end{defn}
  
\begin{lem}\label{decreasing-gives-upper-set}
  Let $U \colon J \to \Oo(J')$ be a map of sets. Then $\gr_U$
  is an upper set of $J \times J'$ with the product order if and only if $U$ is a map of posets $U\colon J\to \Oo(J')^\op$. In particular, $\gr_{\geq f}$ is an upper set if and only if $f\colon J\to J'$ is a nondecreasing map, i.e., a map of posets $J\to J'^\op$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}Assume $(L,U)$ is a map of posets from $J$ to $\Oo(J')^\op$.
Pick $(j,j') \in \gr_U$ and suppose $(j,j') \leq (k,k')$ in $J \times J'$. As $(L,U)$ i monotone and $k\geq j$, we have $U_j\subseteq U_k$; as $(j,j')\in \gr_U$, we have $j' \in U_j$. Therefore $j\in U_k$. Since $U_k$ is an upper set and $k'\geq j'$, we get $k'\in U_k$, i.e. $(k,k')\in \gr_U$. Vice versa, assume $\gr_U$ is an upper set, and let $j\leq k$ in $J$. For any $j'\in U_j$, the element $(k,j')$ in $J\times J'$ satisfies $(k,j')\geq (j,j')$ in the product order and so $(k,j')\in \gr_U$. This means $j'\in U_k$ and so $U_j\subseteq U_k$. To prove the second part of the statement, notice that the map $j\mapsto ((-\infty,j'),[j',+\infty))$ is a map of posets from $J'\to \Oo(J')$. Therefore, if $f\colon J\to J'^\op$ is a map of posets, then also $(<f,\geq f)\colon J \to \Oo(J')^\op$ is a map of posets. Vice versa, if $(<f,\geq f)\colon J \to \Oo(J')^\op$ is a map of posets then for every $j\leq k$ in $J$ we have $[f(j),+\infty)\subseteq [f(k),+\infty)$ and so $f(k)\leq f(j)$.
\end{proof}


\begin{prop}\label{graphs}
  The map 
  \begin{align*}
 \gr \colon \pos(J,\Oo(J')^\op)^\op&\to \Oo(J \times J')\\
   U & \mapsto \gr_U  
  \end{align*}
is an isomorphism of posets. 
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let $U_1\leq U_2$ in the partial order on $\pos(J,\Oo(J')^\op)^\op$, and let $(j,j')\in \gr_{U_2}$. Then $j'\in U_{2;k}\subseteq U_{1,j}$ and so $(j,j')\in \gr_{U_1}$. This means $\gr_{U_1}\leq \gr_{U_2}$ in $\Oo(J \times J')$. Next, for any morphism of posets $U\colon J\to \Oo(J)^\op$ we have that $(j,j')\in \Gamma_{U+1}$ if and only if $j'\in (U+1)_j$
  Pick and upper set $\tilde{U}$ of $J \times J'$ and set, for $j \in J$ $$U_{\tilde{U}}(j)=\{ j' \in J'; \quad  (j,j') \in \tilde{U} \}.$$
  The subset $U_{\tilde{U}}(j)\subseteq J'$ is an upper set. Indeed, if $j'\in U_{\tilde{U}}(j)$ and $k'\geq j'$ in $J'$, then $(j,k')\geq (j,j')$ in the product order on $J\times J'$ and so $(j,k')\in \tilde{U}$ as $\tilde{U}$ is an upper set. Next, if $j\leq k$ in $J$ and $j'\in U_{\tilde{U}}(j)$, then $(k,j')\in \tilde{U}$ as $\tilde{U}$ is an upper set, and so $j'\in U_{\tilde{U}}(k)$. This shows that $U_{\tilde{U}}(j)\subseteq U_{\tilde{U}}(k)$, and so $U_{\tilde{U}}$ is a map of posets from $J$ to $\Oo(J')^\op$. Moreover, if $\tilde{U}_1\leq \tilde{U}_2$ in $\Oo(J\times J')$ then $U_{\tilde{U}_1}\leq U_{\tilde{U}_2}$ in $\pos(J,\Oo(J')^\op)^\op$. Therefore we have a map
   \begin{align*}
\gamma\colon   \Oo(J \times J') &\to \pos(J,\Oo(J')^\op)^\op \\
  \tilde{U} & \mapsto U_{\tilde{U}}.
  \end{align*}
  which is straightforward to see to be the inverse of $\gr$. 
\end{proof}

Assume $J$ and $J'$ are $\Z$-posets. Then $\Oo(J)^\op$ is a $\Z$-poset with $1$ acting as $U\mapsto U-1$. The action of $\Z$ by conjugation on $\pos(J,\Oo(J')^\op)$ is therefore given by $(U\dotplus 1)_j=U_{j-1}-1$. To see that $U\dotplus 1$ is still a morphism of posets from $J$ to $\Oo(J')$, let $j\leq k$ in $J$. Then $(U\dotplus 1)_j=U_{j-1}-1\subseteq U_{k-1}-1=(U\dotplus 1)_k$. 
The conjugation action, however, does not define a structure of $\Z$-poset on $\pos(J,\Oo(J')^\op)$, as it is generally not true that $U\leq U\dotplus1$. This condition is indeed equivalent to $U_{j}\subseteq (U\dotplus 1)_{j}$, i.e., to $U_{j}+1\subseteq U_{j-1}$ for any $j$ in $J$, and this is not necessarily satisfied by a morphism of posets $U\colon J\to \Oo(J')^\op$. 
%On the other hand, a morphism of posets $U\colon J\to \Oo(J')^\op$ surely satisfies $U_{j-1}\subseteq U_{j}$. This motivates the following.
\begin{defn}
A \emph{$(J,J')$-perversity} is a map of posets $U\colon J\to \Oo(J')^\op$ such that 
\[
U_{j}+1\subseteq U_{j-1}%\subseteq U_{j}
\]
for any $j$ in $J$. The set $\mathrm{Perv}(J,J')$ of all $(J,J')$-perversities inherits a poset structure from the inclusion in $\pos(J,\Oo(J')^\op)^\op$. It is a $\Z$-poset with $1$ acting as $U\mapsto U\dotplus(-1)$.
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
Notice that the shift action on $(J,J')$-perversities is given by  $U\mapsto U\dotplus(-1)$. Namely, by construction the $\Z$-action $U\mapsto U\dotplus 1$ is monotone on the set of perversities with the order induced by the inclusion in $\pos(J,\Oo(J')^\op)$, and the order on $\mathrm{Perv}(J,J')$ is the opposite one. The reason for considering this order is, clearly, Proposition \ref{graphs}.
\end{rem}


We have seen in Lemma \ref{decreasing-gives-upper-set} that a function $f\colon J\to J'$ defines a morphism of posets by $(\geq f)\colon J\to \Oo(J')^\op$ if and only if $f$ is a morphism of posets from $J$ to $J'^\op$. When this happens, $(\geq f)$ is a $(J,J')$-perversity if and only if $f(j-1)\leq f(j)+1$, for every $j\in J$. In the particular case $J=\Z$, 
assuming as usual that  $J'$ is a $\Z$-poset, we can define a new function $p_f\colon \Z\to J'$ as $p_f(n)=f(n)+n$. Then the condition $f(n)\leq f(n+1)+1$ translates into 
$p_f(n)\leq p_f(n+1)$, while the condition that $f\colon \Z\to J'^\op$ is a morphism of posets, i.e., $f(n+1)\leq f(n)$ translates to $p_f(n+1)\leq p_f(n)+1$.  As $f\mapsto p_f$ is a bijection of the set of maps from $J$ to $J'$ into itself, we see that the functions $f\colon \Z\to J'$ defining perversities correspond bijectively to the set of functions $p\colon \Z \to J'$ such that
$p(n)\leq p(n+1)\leq p(n)+1$, 
for every $n\in \Z$. This motivates the following (see \cite{??}).

\begin{defn}
A $(\Z,\Z)$-perversity $U$ is said to be defined by a function if there exists $f\colon \Z\to \Z$ such that $U=(\geq f)$. The subset of $(\Z,\Z)$-perversities defined by functions is denoted by $\mathrm{Perv}^\circ(\Z,\Z)$.
\end{defn}
\begin{lem}\label{lemma.perv0}
The subset $\mathrm{Perv}^\circ(\Z,\Z)$ is a $\Z$-sub-poset of $\mathrm{Perv}(\Z,\Z)$. It is isomorphic via $f\mapsto (\geq f)$ with the $\Z$-poset of nonincreasing functions $f\colon \Z\to \Z$ such that $f(n-1)\leq f(n)+1$ with the $\Z$-action given by $(f\dotplus 1)(n)=f(n+1)+1$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
As a function $f\colon \Z\to \Z$ is uniquely determined by the collection of upper sets $[f(n),+\infty)$ the set $\mathrm{Perv}^\circ(J,J')$ bijectivley corresponds to the set of those functions $f\colon \Z\to \Z$ such that $(\geq f)$ is a $(\Z,\Z)$-perversity. As noticed above, these are precisely nonincreasing functions from $\Z$ to itself such that  $f(n-1)\leq f(n)+1$. This bijection is an isomorphism of posets, as $(\geq f_1)\leq (\geq f_2)$ if and only if $f_1\leq f_2$ (in the standard poset structure on the set of maps from $\Z$ to the poset $\Z$). Finally, $((\geq f)\dotplus (-1))_n=(\geq f)_{n+1}+1=[f(n+1)+1,+\infty)=(\geq (f\dotplus 1))_n$, for any $n\in \Z$.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
A \emph{perversity function} (on $\Z$) is a function $p\colon \Z\to \Z$ such that
\[
p(n)\leq p(n+1)\leq p(n)+1,
\]
for every $n\in Z$. The set $\mathrm{perv}_\Z$ of perversity functions is a poset with the partial order induced by the inclusion $\mathrm{perv}_\Z\subseteq \pos(\Z,\Z)$. It is a $\Z$-poset with the action $(p\dotplus1)(n)=p(n+1)$. 
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
Notice that the $\Z$-action on perversity functions is a monotone action since, by definition of perversity function, we have $p(n)\leq p(n+1)$ and this precisely means $p(n)\leq (p\dotplus1)(n)$.
\end{rem}
\begin{lem}
For every $p\colon \Z \to \Z$, let $f_p\colon \Z\to \Z$ be the map defined by $f_p(n)= p(n)-n$. Then $p\mapsto (\geq f_p)$ is an isomorphism of $\Z$-posets between $\mathrm{perv}_\Z$ and $\mathrm{Perv}^\circ(\Z,\Z)$
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
By Lemma \ref{lemma.perv0} we only need to show that $p\mapsto f_p$ is a monotone $\Z$-equivariant bijection between  $\mathrm{perv}_\Z$ and the set of functions $f\colon \Z\to \Z$ such that $f(n)\leq f(n-1)\leq f(n)+1$. That it is a bijection is immediate: the inverse map is $f\mapsto p_f$, where $p_f(n)=f(n)+n$. To see that it is an isomorphism of posets, notice that $f_{p_1}\leq f_{p_2}$ if and only if $p_1(n)-n\leq p_2(n)-n$ for every $n\in \Z$, and so if and only if $p_1(n)\leq p_2(n)$ for every $n\in \Z$. Finally, $f_{p\dotplus1}(n)=(p\dotplus 1)(n)-n=p(n+1)-n=f_p(n+1)+1=(f_p\dotplus 1)(n)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
An upper set $U$ in $\Oo(J\times J')$ is called a \emph{kinky upperset} if $U\leq U+_\mathrm{ne}1$, where ${\mathrm{ne}}$ is the ``northestern'' action of $\Z$ on $J\times J'$ given by
$(j,j')+_{\mathrm{ne}}1=(j-1,j'+1)$. We denote by $\mathrm{Kink}(J\times J')$ the poset of kinky uppersets of $J\times J'$, with the poset structure induced by the inclusion in $\Oo(J\times J')$. it is a $\Z$-poset with the ``northestern'' action. We denote by $\mathrm{Kink}^\circ(J\times J')$ the $\Z$-sub-poset of nontrivial kinky uppersets of $J\times J'$, where 
the trivial upperstes are $\emptyset$ and $J\times J'$.
\end{defn}

\begin{lem}
 The map $\Gamma$ from Proposition \ref{graphs} induces an isomorphism of $\Z$-posets
  \[
 \gr \colon \mathrm{Perv}(J,J')\to \mathrm{Kink}(J\times J').
  \]
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
Let $U\colon J\to \Oo(J')^\op$ be a perversity, and let $(j,j')\in \Gamma_U$. Then $j'\in U_{j}$ and so, by definition of perversity, $j'+1\in U_{j-1}$. Therefore $(j-1,j'+1)\in \Gamma_U$, i.e., $\Gamma_U\leq \Gamma_U+_{\mathrm{ne}} 1$. Vice versa, if $\tilde{U}$ is a kinky upperset in $J\times J'$, let $U_{\tilde{U}}$ the preimage in $\pos(J,\Oo(J')^\op)^\op$ of $\tilde{U}$ via $\Gamma$ (see the proof of Proposition \ref{graphs}). Then for any $j\in J$ and any $j'\in U_{\tilde{U};j}$ we have $j'+1\in U_{\tilde{U};j-1}$ and so $U_{\tilde{U};j}+1\subseteq U_{\tilde{U};j-1}$. So the isomorphism of posets $\pos(J,\Oo(J')^\op)^\op\to \Oo(J \times J')$ restricts to an isomorphism of posets $\mathrm{Perv}(J,J')\to \mathrm{Kink}(J\times J')$. To see that $ \gr \colon \mathrm{Perv}(J,J')\to \mathrm{Kink}(J\times J')$ is also $\Z$-equivariant, notice that, for every perversity $U$ we have $(j,j')\in \Gamma_{U\dotplus (-1)}$ if and only if $j'\in U_{j+1}+1$. i.e., if and only if $(j+1,j'-1)\in \Gamma_U$. This latter condition is equivalent to $(j,j')\in \Gamma_U+_{\mathrm{nw}}1$, so we find $\Gamma_{U\dotplus (-1)}=\Gamma_U+_{\mathrm{nw}}1$.
\end{proof}



\begin{lem}
The map $\Gamma$ from Proposition \ref{graphs} induces an isomorphism of $\Z$-posets
  \[
 \gr \colon \mathrm{Perv}^\circ(\Z,\Z)\to \mathrm{Kink}^\circ(\Z\times \Z).
  \]
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
A kinky upperset $U$ is in the image of $\Gamma$ if and only if $U$ is of the form $(\geq f)$ for a suitable function $f\colon \Z\to \Z$. This is possible if and only if $U_n\neq \emptyset,\Z$ for every $n\in \Z$. As $U$ is kinky, if $U_{n_0}=\emptyset$ for some $n_0$, then $U_{n_0+1}+1\subseteq U_{n_0}=\emptyset$, and so $U_{n_0+1}=\emptyset$. Inductively, this gives $U_n=\emptyset$ for every $n\geq n_0$.  On the other hand, since a kinky upperset is an upperset, if there exists a nonempty $U_n$ with $n<n_0$, then there exist an element $(n,m)$ in $U$ and so, since $(n,m)\leq (n_0,m)$, also $ (n_0,m)\in U$. But then $m\in U_{n_0}$, which is impossible. So also the $U_n$ with $n<n_0$ are empty and therefore $U=\emptyset$. Similarly, if $U_{n_0}=\Z$ for some $n_0$, then $U_n=\Z$ for every $n>n_0$ as $U$ is an upperset, while the kinkiness condition $U_{n}+1\subseteq U_{n-1}$ implies that also $U_{n_0-1}=\Z$ and so inductively that all $U_n$ with $n<n_0$ are the whole of $\Z$. That is, $U=\Z\times\Z$ in this case. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lem}\label{equiv}
The isomorphism of $\Z$-modules $\varphi\colon \Z^2\to \Z^2$ given by $\varphi\colon (n,n')\mapsto (n+n',n')$ induces an isomorphism of $\Z$-posets 
\[
\varphi\colon \mathrm{Kink}(\Z\times \Z)\xrightarrow{\sim} \Oo(\Z\times \Z),
\]
where the $\Z$-action on $\Oo(\Z\times \Z)$ is the one induced by the ``northern'' $\Z$-action on $\Z^2$, namely, $(n,n')+1=(n,n'+1)$. In particular $\varphi$ induces an isomorphism of $\Z$-posets $\mathrm{Kink}^{\circ}(\Z\times \Z)\xrightarrow{\sim} \Oo(\Z\times \Z)\setminus\{\emptyset,\Z\times\Z\}$.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
A subset $U$ of $\Z\times \Z$ is an upper set (in the product order) if and only if $U+K\subseteq U$, where $K$ is the $\Z$-cone spanned by $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1\\0\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ and $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0\\1\end{smallmatrix}\right)$, while $U$ is a kinky upperset if and only if $U+K^\mathrm{kink}\subseteq U$, where $K^\mathrm{kink}$ is the $\Z$-cone spanned by $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1\\0\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ and $\left(\begin{smallmatrix}-1\\1\end{smallmatrix}\right)$. Morever the $\Z$ action on the uppersets is generated by $U\mapsto U+\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0\\1\end{smallmatrix}\right)$ and the the $\Z$ action on the kinky uppersets is generated by $U\mapsto U+\left(\begin{smallmatrix}-1\\1\end{smallmatrix}\right)$, where in both cases the sum on the right hand side is the sum in $\Z^2$. As $\varphi \colon \Z^2\to \Z^2$ is an isomorphism of $\Z$-modules with $\varphi(K^\mathrm{kink})=K$ and $\varphi\left(\begin{smallmatrix}-1\\1\end{smallmatrix}\right)=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0\\1\end{smallmatrix}\right)$, the statement follows ($\varphi$ is manifestly inclusion preserving).
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}\label{corperv}
We have an isomorphism of $\Z$-posets
\[
\mathrm{perv}_\Z\xrightarrow{\sim} \Oo(\Z\times \Z)\setminus\{\emptyset,\Z\times\Z\}
\]
mapping a perversity function $p$ to the image via the isomorphism $\varphi\colon (n,n')\mapsto (n+n',n')$ of the set $\{(n,n')\in \Z\times \Z\text{ such that } n'\geq p(n)-n\}$.
\end{cor}
\begin{exmp}
The zero perversity function $p(n)\equiv 0$ corresponds to the upper set $\{(n,n')\in \Z\times \Z\text{ such that } n\geq 0\}$; the identity perversity function $p(n)\equiv n$ corresponds to the upper set $\{(n,n')\in \Z\times \Z\text{ such that } n'\geq 0\}$.
\end{exmp}

\subsection{Slicing the heart}
Let $\mathscr{D}$ be a stable $\infty$-category. Then, as we recalled above, a bounded t-structure on $\mathscr{D}$ is the datum of a Bridgeland $\Z$-slicing $\tee$ of $\mathscr{D}$. Let $\heartsuit_{\mathfrak{t}}$ denote the heart of $\mathfrak{t}$. Then an abelian $\Z$-slicing of $\heartsuit_{\mathfrak{t}}$ is the datum of an extension $\tilde{\tee}$ of $\tee$ to a Bridgeland $\Z\times_{\mathrm{lex}}\hat{\Z}$-slicing on $\mathscr{D}$, where $\hat{\Z}$ denotes the $\Z$-poset consisting of $\Z$ endowed wth the trivial $Z$-action, and the morphism $\Oo(\Z)\to \Oo(\Z\times_{\mathrm{lex}}\hat{\Z})$ is induced by the projection on the first factor $\Z\times_{\mathrm{lex}}\hat{\Z}\to \Z$. See \cite[Section??]{??}. We will denote by $\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi}$ the $\phi$-th slice of the heart of $\tee$. In other words,
\[
\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi}=\mathscr{D}_{\tilde{\tee};(0,\phi)}.
\]
Notice that we have
\[
\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi}[n]=\mathscr{D}_{\tilde{\tee};(n,\phi)},
\]
where $[n]$ denotes the ``shift by $n$'' functor on $\mathscr{D}$.

\begin{exmp}
Via the obvious inclusion of $\Z$-posets $\{0,1\}\hookrightarrow\hat{\Z}$, any torsion pair $(\heartsuit_{\tee;0},\heartsuit_{\tee;1})$ on $\heartsuit_{\mathfrak{t}}$ defines an abelian $\Z$-slicing on $\heartsuit_{\mathfrak{t}}$.
\end{exmp}
\begin{defn}
Let $\mathfrak{t}$ be a bounded t-structure on $\mathscr{D}$. An abelian $\mathbb{Z}$-slicing $\hat{\tee}$ on $\heartsuit_{\mathfrak{t}}$ is called:
\begin{itemize}
%\item \emph{perverse %filtration
%} if $\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi}\orth\heartsuit_{\tee;\psi}[n]$ for $\phi>\psi+n$; 
\item \emph{grading %filtration
} (or \emph{radical}) if $\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi}\orth\heartsuit_{\tee;\psi}[n]$ for $\phi>\psi+n$ and %$\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi }\orth \heartsuit_{\tee;\psi}[n]$
 for $\phi=\psi+n$ with $n\geq 2$; 
\item \emph{gluable} if $\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi}\orth \heartsuit_{\tee;\psi}[n]$ %and $\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi}\orth \heartsuit_{\tee;\psi}[n+1]$ 
for $\phi>\psi$ and $n>0$;
%\item \emph{mixed %filtration
%} if $\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi }\orth\heartsuit_{\tee;\psi}[n]$ for $ \phi > \psi -n$.  
\end{itemize} 
\end{defn}
\begin{rem}
The definition of gluable abelian $\Z$-slicing of $\heartsuit_\tee$ is the specialization of Definition \ref{gluable} to $J_1=\Z$ and $J_2=\hat{\Z}$.
\end{rem}
\begin{rem}
Historically, grading filtrations first appeared in \cite{ekh} under the name of `radical filtrations', while mixed filtrations are covered in the last section of \cite{kos}.
\end{rem}
\begin{exmp}
Let  $(\heartsuit_{\tee;0},\heartsuit_{\tee;1})$ be a torsion pair on $\heartsuit_{\mathfrak{t}}$. Then $(\heartsuit_{\tee;0},\heartsuit_{\tee;1})$, seen as an abelian $\Z$-slicing, is grading. Namely, as $\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi}[n]=0$ for $\phi \notin\{ 0,1\}$, the only nontrivial orthogonality conditions to be checked are:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] $\heartsuit_{\tee;0}\orth\heartsuit_{\tee;0}[n]$ for $n<0$;
\item[-] $\heartsuit_{\tee;0}\orth\heartsuit_{\tee;1}[n]$ for $n<-1$;
\item[-] $\heartsuit_{\tee;1}\orth\heartsuit_{\tee;0}[n]$ for $n<1$;
\item[-] $\heartsuit_{\tee;1}\orth\heartsuit_{\tee;1}[n]$ for $n<0$.
\end{itemize}
These all follows from the orthogonality relation $\heartsuit_{\tee}\orth \heartsuit_\tee[n]$ for $n< 0$, except for $\heartsuit_{\tee;1}\orth\heartsuit_{\tee;0}$ which is true by definition of torsion pair.
\end{exmp}

%\begin{lem}\label{mix-to-glue}
%Let $\mathfrak{t}$ be a bounded t-structure on $\mathscr{D}$, and let $\hat{\tee}$ be an abelian $\mathbb{Z}$-slicing on $\heartsuit_{\mathfrak{t}}$. If $\tilde{\tee}$ is mixed, then $\tilde{\tee}$ is gluable.
%\end{lem}
%\begin{proof}
%Let $\phi$ and $\psi$ be in $\Z$ with $\phi>\psi$, and let $n>0$. Then $\phi>\psi-n$ and so, by definition of mixed slicing,  $\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi }\orth\heartsuit_{\tee;\psi}[n]$. Therefore, $\tilde{\tee}$ is gluable.
%\end{proof}
\begin{prop}\label{glue-to-grad}
Let $\mathfrak{t}$ be a bounded t-structure on $\mathscr{D}$, and let $\hat{\tee}$ be an abelian $\mathbb{Z}$-slicing on $\heartsuit_{\mathfrak{t}}$. If $\tilde{\tee}$ is gluable, then $\tilde{\tee}$ is grading.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $\phi$ and $\psi$ be in $\Z$ with $\phi>\psi+n$.
The orthogonality condition $\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi}\orth\heartsuit_{\tee;\psi}[n]$ is trivially satisfied if $n<0$, so let us assume $n\geq 0$. If $n=0$, then $\phi>\psi$ and the orthogonaliy condition $\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi}\orth\heartsuit_{\tee;\psi}$ is satisfied by definition of slicing. Finally, if $n>0$, then we have $\phi>\psi$ and $n>0$, so $\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi}\orth\heartsuit_{\tee;\psi}[n]$ by definition of gluable slicing. %This shows that $\tilde{\tee}$ is perverse. 
If $\phi=\psi+n$ with $n\geq 2$, then in particular $\phi>\psi$ and $n>0$, so again $\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi}\orth\heartsuit_{\tee;\psi}[n]$. 
\end{proof}

%As a  grading abelian $\Z$ slicing on a heart is perverse by definition, Lemmas \ref{mix-to-glue} and \ref{glue-to-grad} above toghether give the following.
%\begin{prop}
%For an abelian $\Z$ slicing on a heart of a bounded $t$-structure, the following chain of implications holds: 
%$$\textnormal{mixed} \implies \textnormal{gluable} \implies \textnormal{grading} \implies \textnormal{perverse} $$
%\end{prop}

%Clearly, a torsion pair on $\heartsuit_{\mathfrak{t}}$ (seen as an abelian $\mathbb{Z}$-slicing via the inclusion $[1] \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$) is always a grading filtration {\color{red}(proof: it follows from the fact that $\mathscr{P}_{\phi}[n]=0$ for $\phi \not = 0,1$ and thus the only nontrivial case is $n=0, \phi=1, \psi=0$. The Hom-vanishing then follows from the definition of torsion pair)}. 
%
%
%{\color{red}proof that mixed implies grading: suppose $n< \phi - \psi$. By definition of slicing, the vanishing is automatic for $n \le 0$ and we can thus assume $n>0$. But then $n>0>-n>\psi-\phi$ and the required vanishing now follows from the definition of mixed filtration. The same argument also works for $2 \le n = \phi - \psi$}. \\

%\begin{defn}
%Let $J$ be a $\Z$-poset. A \emph{perversity} on $J$ is a monotone map $p \colon \Z \to \Oo(J)$ such that $$p(n)-n \leq p(m) -m$$
%whenever $m \leq n$ in $\Z$. The set of all perversities on $J$ will be denoted $\per(J)$. 
%\end{defn}
%
%In other words, a perversity is a map of posets $p \colon \Z \to \Oo(J)$ such that
%\[
%n\mapsto p(n)-n
%\]
%is a map of posets $\Z \to \Oo(J)^\op$.
%
%Equivalently, a perversity is a map $p\colon \Z\to \Oo(J)$ such that
%\[
%p(n)\leq p(n+1)\leq p(n)+1
%\]
%If we write $p(n)=q(n)+n$ this becomes
%\[
%q(n)-1\leq q(n+1)\leq q(n)
%\]
%or
%\[
%q(n+1)\leq q(n)\leq q(n+1)+1
%\]
%In terms of the uppersets $U_{k}=[k,+\infty)$ this is
%\[
%U_{q(n)}\subseteq U_{q(n+1)}\subseteq U_{q(n)}-1
%\]
%\begin{lem}Let $\Psi\colon \pos(\Z,\Oo(J)^\op)\to\pos(\Z,\Oo(J)^\op)$ be the map defined by
%\[
%\Psi(q)\colon n \mapsto q(n)+n.
%\]
%Then $\Psi$ induces a bijection between $\pos(\Z,\Oo(J)^\op)$ and $\per(J)$.
%\end{lem}
%\begin{proof}
%To begin with, let us check that $\Psi$ is actually a map from $\pos(\Z,\Oo(J)^\op)$ to itself. If $q\colon \Z \to \Oo(J)^\op$ is a map of posets, and $n\leq m$ then
%\[
%(\Psi(q))(n)=q(n)+n\leq q(m)+m=(\Psi(q))(m)

%\begin{prop}\label{grad0}
%Let $\mathfrak{t}$ be a bounded t-structure on $\mathscr{D}$, let $\tilde{\tee}$ be an abelian $\mathbb{Z}$-slicing on $\heartsuit_{\mathfrak{t}}$, let $p\colon \Z\to \Z$ be a perversity function, and let $f_p\colon \mathbb{Z} \ltimes \hat{\mathbb{Z}}\to \mathbb{Z} \ltimes \hat{\mathbb{Z}}$ be the $\Z$-equivariant map given by $$f_p(n,\phi)=(n+p(\lfloor \phi / 2 \rfloor),-p(\lfloor \phi / 2 \rfloor)),$$
%where $\Z$ acts diagonally both on the source and on the target. If $\tilde{\tee}$ is perverse, then $\tilde{\tee}$ is $f_p$-compatible.
%\end{prop}
\begin{prop}\label{grad}
Let $\mathfrak{t}$ be a bounded t-structure on $\mathscr{D}$, let $\tilde{\tee}$ be an abelian $\mathbb{Z}$-slicing on $\heartsuit_{\mathfrak{t}}$,  let $p\colon \Z\to \Z$ be a perversity function, and let $g_p\colon \mathbb{Z} \times_{\mathrm{lex}} \hat{\mathbb{Z}}\to \mathbb{Z} \times_{\mathrm{lex}} \hat{\mathbb{Z}}$ be the $\Z$-equivariant map given by $$g_p(n,\phi)=(n+p(\phi),-p(\phi)),$$
where $\Z$ acts diagonally both on the source and on the target.\footnote{The function $g_p$ is clearly $\Z$-equivariant, as the action on the second factor is the trivial one.} If $\tilde{\tee}$ is grading, then $\tilde{\tee}$ is $g_p$-compatible.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Assume $\tilde{\tee}$ is grading.  Let $(n,\phi)$ and $(m,\psi)$ in $\Z\times_{\mathrm{lex}} \Z$ with $(n,\phi)\leq (m,\psi)$ such that $g_p(n,\phi)>g_p(m,\psi)$ in $\Z\times_{\mathrm{lex}} \Z$. By definition of $g_p$ this means that we have
\[
(n+p(\phi),-p(\phi))>(m+p(\psi),-p(\psi))
\]
in $\Z\times_{\mathrm{lex}} \Z$, i.e., that $n+p(\phi)>m+p(\psi)$ or that $n+p(\phi)=m+p(\psi)$ and $p(\psi)>p(\phi)$. Similarly, the condition $(n,\phi)\leq (m,\psi)$ means that either $n<m$ or $n=m$ and $\phi\leq \psi$. By considering all possibilities, and taking into account that a perversity function is nondecreasing, one sees that there is actually a single case to deal with:
\begin{itemize}
\item $p(\phi)-p(\psi)>m-n$, with $m>n$ and $\phi>\psi$;
%\item $n=m$ and $p(\phi)>p(\psi)$ with $\phi\leq \psi$.
%\item $n+p(\phi)=m+p(\psi)$ with $n<m$ and $p(\psi)>p(\phi)$;
%\item $n+p(\phi)=m+p(\psi)$ and $p(\psi)>p(\phi)$ and $n=m$ and $\phi\leq \psi$.
\end{itemize}
As $p$ is a perversity function, if $\phi\geq \psi$ then
\[
0\leq p(\phi)-p(\psi)\leq \phi-\psi,
\]
so we have
\[
\phi\geq \psi+ p(\phi)-p(\psi)>\psi+m-n.
\]
Since $\tilde{\tee}$ is grading, this implies $\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi}\orth\heartsuit_{\tee;\psi}[m-n]$, and so $\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi}[n]\orth \heartsuit_{\tee;\psi}[m]$, i.e.,
\[
\mathscr{D}_{\tilde{\tee};(n,\phi)}\orth\mathscr{D}_{\tilde{\tee};(m,\psi)}.
\]
Since $\phi>\psi+m-n$, either $\phi>\psi+m-n+1$ or $\phi=\psi+m-n+1$. In the first case, reasoning as above we find $\mathscr{D}_{\tilde{\tee};(n,\phi)}\orth\mathscr{D}_{\tilde{\tee};(m,\psi)}[1]$. In the second case, as $m>n$ we have $m-n+1\geq 2$. As $\tilde{\tee}$ is grading, this gives $\heartsuit_{\tee;\phi}\orth\heartsuit_{\tee;\psi}[m-n+1]$, i.e., again
\[
\mathscr{D}_{\tilde{\tee};(n,\phi)}\orth\mathscr{D}_{\tilde{\tee};(m,\psi)}[1].
\]
\end{proof}

%\begin{prop}\label{grad2}
%Let $\mathfrak{t}$ be a bounded t-structure on $\mathscr{D}$, let $\tilde{\tee}$ be an abelian $\mathbb{Z}$-slicing on $\heartsuit_{\mathfrak{t}}$,  let $p\colon \Z\to \Z$ be a perversity function, and let $g_p\colon \mathbb{Z} \ltimes \hat{\mathbb{Z}}\to \mathbb{Z} \ltimes \hat{\mathbb{Z}}$ be the $\Z$-equivariant map given by $$g_p(n,\phi)=(n+p(\phi),-p(\phi)),$$
%where $\Z$ acts diagonally both on the source and on the target. With some abuse of nototation, denote by ${g_p}_!\tee$ the bounded $t$-structure on $\mathscr{D}$ induced by the $\Z\times \hat{\Z}$-slicing ${g_p}_!\tilde{\tee}$ via the projection on the first factor $\Z\times \hat{\Z}\to \Z$.
%If $\tilde{\tee}$ is mixed, then  then the abelian $\mathbb{Z}$-slicing ${g_p}_!\tilde{\tee}$ on $\heartsuit_{{g_p}_!\tee}$ is split.

{\color{red} Quanto segue va rivisto alla luce della chiacchierata su wire: dobbiamo introdurre la nozione di strong semiorthogonal decomposition e notare che nel caso in cui abbiamo strong e t-strutture scambiabili allora abbiamo due modi di incollare e questi coincidono.}
We now recall the celebrated process from {\color{red} BBD} of gluing two $t$-structures into a third one. This will turn out to induce a gluable slicing in our sense, thus showing that the language of the present paper is actually a generalization of a classical piece of literature. This, by the other hand, explains both our terminology and motivation.

\begin{defn}\label{recoll}
  A \emph{recollement datum} is a diagram of stable $\infty$-categories and exact $\infty$-functors 
\[
\xymatrix{
  \mathscr{D}_{\mathrm{fer}}\ar[r]_{i_*}  & \mathscr{D} \ar@/^2pc/[l]^{i^!} \ar[r]_{j^*} \ar@/_2pc/[l]^{i^*} & \mathscr{D}_{\mathrm{ouv}} \ar@/^2pc/[l]^{j_*} \ar@/_2pc/[l]^{j_!}\\
}
\]
such that the following holds:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $(i^*,i_*,i^!)$ and $(j_!,j^*,j_*)$ are adjoint triples,
\item $i_*, j_*, j_!$ are fully faithful and $j^*i_* =0$,
\item for each object $X$ of $\mathscr{D}$ the (co)units of the above adjunctions give rise to cofiber sequences \\
  
\begin{tabular}{cc}
 \begin{minipage}{2in}   
\[
\xymatrix{
i_*i^!X\ar[r]\ar[d] & X\ar[d] \\
0\ar[r]& j_*j^*X
}
\]
 \end{minipage}
&
\begin{minipage}{2in}   
\[
\xymatrix{
j_!j^*X\ar[r]\ar[d] & X\ar[d] \\
0\ar[r]& i_*i^*X.
}
\]
 \end{minipage}
\end{tabular}
\end{enumerate} 
\end{defn}

\begin{prop}
  Suppose we are in the situation of \ref{recoll}. Then:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $(\mathscr{D}_0=j_*\mathscr{D}_{\mathrm{ouv}}, \mathscr{D}_1=i_*\mathscr{D}_{\mathrm{fer}})$ is a semiorthogonal decomposition on $\mathscr{D}$.
  \item Given $t$-structures $\tee_0, \tee_1$ on $\mathscr{D}_{\mathrm{ouv}}$ and $\mathscr{D}_{\mathrm{fer}}$ respectively, the associated $\{0,1\}\lex \Z$-slicing on $\mathscr{D}$ given by
  \[
  \mathscr{D}_{0;\geq 0}=j_*(\mathscr{D}_{\mathrm{ouv};\geq 0}), \quad \mathscr{D}_{1;\geq 0}=i_*(\mathscr{D}_{\mathrm{fer};\geq 0})
  \]
   is gluable. 
  \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  Let's prove the first claim. The fact that $j^*$ and $j_*$ are adjoints implies that, for objects $i_*X \in \mathscr{D}_{\mathrm{fer}}$ and $j_*Y \in \mathscr{D}_{\mathrm{ouv}}$, $$\mathscr{D}(i_*X,j_*Y)=\mathscr{D}(j^*i_*X,Y)$$
  and the latter vanishes since $j^*i_*=0$ by definition. This shows that $\mathscr{D}_1 \orth \mathscr{D}_0$. Considering the left cofiber sequence from Definition \ref{recoll} as a Postnikov tower of length one we see that $(\mathscr{D}_0,\mathscr{D}_1)$ is a $\{0,1\}$-slicing on $\mathscr{D}$, as desired. \\

  
\end{proof}

%\begin{rem}
%  In {\color{red}ref: BBD} the authors consider a process consisting in gluing $t$-structures on a pair of triangulated categories to obtain a $t$-structure on a third one. In their setting, the three categories are linked by an abstraction of the Grothendieck's six-functors formalism. However, the latter is more or less equivalent to the datum of a semiorthogonal decomposition (i.e., a $\{0,1 \}$-slicing, where $\{0,1 \}$ is the toset with two elements and trivial $\Z$-action) on the third category so that the input of the two (bounded) $t$-structures gives rise to a gluable $\{0,1\} \lex \Z$-slicing $\tee$. Then the $\Z \lex \{0,1 \}$-slicing $e_! \tee$ is just the new glued $t$-structure together with the natural torsion pair on its heart. This explains our terminology and links the language of the present paper to the classical theory of $t$-structures.

\section{A zoo of examples} 
{\color{red} Reminder: da mettere prima di tutto il tilting a la referenza a collins}. We now link the notions of the present paper with different work from literature. To begin with, we recall the following defintion from {\color{red}referenza a ekhedal}. 

\begin{defn}\label{radical}
A Bridgeland $\Z \lex \triv$-slicing of $\mathscr{D}$ is called \emph{radical filtration} if it is $\alpha$-compatible, where $\alpha \colon \Z \lex \triv \to \Z \lex \triv$ is defined as $\alpha(n,m)=(n-m,-m)$. 
\end{defn}

{\color{red} forse conviene mettere la definizione esplicita con gli Ext, che e' ovviamente quella di ekhedal}.

\begin{rem}
Let $\tee$ be a  Bridgeland $\Z \lex \triv$-slicing of $\mathscr{D}$ and suppose that $\mathscr{D}_{=(n,m)}= \mathbf{0}$ for $m \in \Z \setminus \{ 0,1 \}$. Then $\tee$ is a radical filtration. To give such a slicing is equivalent to the data of a bounded $t$-structure of $\mathscr{D}$ together with an abelian $\{0,1\}$-slicing (i.e., a torsion pair in the sense of {\color{red}referenza}) on its heart.
\end{rem}

\begin{rem}
It is easy to see that the map $\varphi$ from Lemma \ref{equiv} is indeed an isomorphism of $\mathbb{Z}$-posets $\varphi \colon \Z \lex \triv \to \Z \lex \Z$ where $\triv$ denotes $\Z$ (as a poset) endowed with the  trivial action by integers. 
\end{rem}

The following Lemma shows how natural is the apparently sophisticated definition of a radical filtration. 

\begin{lem}
  Let $\tee$ be a  Bridgeland $\Z \lex \triv$-slicing of $\mathscr{D}$. Then $\tee$ is a radical filtration if and only if $\varphi_! \tee$ is a gluable $\Z \lex \Z$-slicing. In this case,
  \[
  \alpha_! \tee = ( \varphi^{-1} e \varphi)_! \tee
  \]
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
  This simply follows from the commutativity of the following diagram of $\Z$-posets:
  \[
\xymatrix{
\Z \lex \triv \ar[r]^{\alpha} \ar[d]^{\varphi} & \Z \lex \triv \ar[d]^{\varphi} \\
\Z \lex \Z \ar[r]^{e} & \Z \lex \Z 
}
\]
\end{proof}

\begin{defn}
  Let $p$ be a perversity function (on $\Z$). We define $\alpha_p \colon \Z \lex \triv \to \Z \lex \triv$ as $\alpha_p(n,m)=(m-p(n),-p(n))$. 
\end{defn}

\begin{rem}
The map $\alpha$ from Definition \ref{radical} corresponds simply to $\alpha_1$, where $1$ denotes the identity of $\mathbb{Z}$. The identity itself is a special perveristy function: it is the only idempotent one {\color{red} questo dovrebbe essere il motivo combinatorio per la dualita' di Koszul}. 
\end{rem}

\begin{lem}\label{incolla1}
  Let $\tee$ be a  Bridgeland $\Z \lex \triv$-slicing of $\mathscr{D}$. The following hold: 
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item If $\tee$ is gluable, then it is a radical filtration.  
   \item If $\tee$ is a radical filtration, then it is $\alpha_p$-compatible for every perversity function $p$. By considering the $t$-structure associated to $(\alpha_p)_!\tee$, this defines a morphism of $\mathbb{Z}$-posets:
     \[
     \mathrm{perv}_\Z \to \ts(\mathscr{D})
     \]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
{\color{red} Si fa coi conti. Tuttavia mi piacerebbe trovare una prova piu' concettuale che si basi sul Lemma 1.3.}
\end{proof}

Starting with a radical filtration $\tee$ we can then use the isomorphism from Corollary \ref{corperv} to get a morphism of $\Z$-posets
\[
 \Oo(\Z \times \Z) \rightarrow \ts(\mathscr{D}) 
 \]
 This can finally be regarded as a cohomology theory where dimension is an element of the poset $\Z \times \Z$, which is not totally ordered. In a certain sense, \textit{dimensions are not always comparable}. \\
 
Now, the notion of gluability is somehow asymmetric. However, one implication always holds, as shown below.

\begin{lem}\label{incolla2}
Let $J_1$  and $J_2$ be $\Z$-tosets, $\tee$ be a Bridgeland $J_1 \lex J_2$-slicing of $\mathscr{D}$. If $\tee$ is gluable and $\Z$ acts trivially on $J_1$, then $e_! \tee$ is a gluable $J_2 \lex J_1$ slicing of $\mathscr{D}$. 
\end{lem}

\begin{rem}\label{incollarem}
  The notion of Bridgeland $\triv$-slicing already appears in literature: it is no more than an infinite version of a semiorthogonal decomposition in the sense of {\color{red} referenza}, or a '\textit{baric structure}' as defined in {\color{red} referenza}. Thus, we can start with a baric structure of $\mathscr{D}$ and a boudned $t$-structure of $\mathscr{D}_{= n}$ for every $n \in \triv$. If the associated $\triv \lex \Z$-slicing $\tee$ is gluable, $e_!\tee$ is gluable by Lemma \ref{incolla2} and thus, using Lemma \ref{incolla2} we get a morphism of $\Z$-posets
  \[
  \mathrm{perv}_\Z \rightarrow \ts(\mathscr{D})
  \]
  We can build like that whole new classes of 'perverse' $t$-structures on $\mathscr{D}$. We'll see an instance of this construction in the example below. 
\end{rem}
  
\begin{exmp}
  In this example we relate the gluability condition with the Beilinson-Soul\'e conjecture from motivic topology. We fix a field $k$ and, just for this example, we stick to a more traditional $1$-categorical setup. Recall that the existence of motives, which is still an open question in general, was conjectured by Grothendieck in order to build a universal Weyl cohomology (also called 'motivic cohomology') theory for schemes. However, Deligne observed that it could be easier to construct a triangulated category (the 'mixed' motives) which should play the role of the derived category of motives, and later recover the latter as the heart of a bounded $t$-structure. Voedvodskij finally succeded in constructing a triangulated category of mixed rational motives over $k$ which contains, for $n \in \Z$, a 'Tate object' $\mathbb{Q}(n)$ that represents the $n$-th motivic cohomology functor. Now, let us consider the triangualted subcategory $\mathscr{D}\textnormal{TM}_k$ generated by the Tate objects. In other words, $\mathscr{D}\textnormal{TM}_k$ is the category of mixed rational Tate motives. We then get isomorphisms of groups
  \[
   \mathscr{D}\textnormal{TM}_k(\mathbb{Q}(i),\mathbb{Q}(j)[n])=K_{2(j-i)-n}(k)^{(j-i)}
   \]
   where $K_a(k)$ is the $a$-th higher $K$-theory group of the point $\textnormal{Spec}(k)$ and $K_a(k)^{(b)}$ is the weight $b$ summand of $K_a(k) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} \mathbb{Q}$ with respect to the Adams action (in other words, $K_a(k)^{(b)}$ is the $a$-th $b$-codimensional Bloch's higher Chow group of $\textnormal{Spec}(k)$ with rational coefficients). For dimensional reasons we immediately see that the right hand side vanishes for $i < j$ and, when $i = j$, for $n \neq 0$. In other words, the Tate objects form an infinite exceptional collection ({\color{red} referenza a decomposizioni semiortogonali}) on $\mathscr{D}\textnormal{TM}_k$ which is clearly full by definition. By the general theory of semiorthogonal decomposition, this simply means that setting $(\mathscr{D}\textnormal{TM}_k)_{=n}$ as the triangulated subcategory generated by $\mathbb{Q}(n)$ defines slices of a baric structure with exact equivalences
   \[
   (\mathscr{D}\textnormal{TM}_k)_{=n} \simeq \mathscr{D}^b(\mathbb{Q})
   \]
   where the member on the right is the bounded derived category of finite-dimensional rational vector spaces (which is equivalent to the abelian category graded vector spaces which finite-dimensional homogeneous pieces). The latter, being a derived category, posseses a canonical bounded $t$-structure and this finally induces a Bridgeland $\triv \lex \Z$ slicing on $\mathscr{D}\textnormal{TM}_k$. \\
   Now, the latter slicing is gluable if and only if  $K_{2(j-i)-n}(k)^{(j-i)} = \mathbf{0}$  whenever both $i < j$ and $n \leq 0$ hold. This is exactly the Beilinson-Soul\'e standard vanishing conjecture, which is now known to hold, for example, when $k$ is a number field due to a celebrated computation by Borel. In this case, by applying $e_!$ we get a Bridgeland $\Z \lex \triv$-slicing on $\mathscr{D}\textnormal{TM}_k$ and thus a bounded $t$-structure whose heart contains the desired unmixed Tate motives over $k$. In other words, we recover a well known fact (see {\color{red} referenza Levine}) using a rather abstract and general language: assuming the Beilinson-Soul\'e conjecture, (Tate) motives exist. \\
   Moreover, following the route of Remark \ref{incollarem}, we get a $t$-structure for each perversity function. Those are the '\textit{perverse motives}' appearing in {\color{red} referenza}. 
\end{exmp}

\begin{rem}
We can give $\per(J)$ the structure of a $\Z$-poset via the incluion $\per(J) \subseteq \pos(\Z,\Oo(J)^\op)$. In general, it will not be totally ordered. However, by taking joins and meets pointwise $\per(J)$ becomes a distributive lattice. 
\end{rem}

\begin{rem}
Considering the obvious isomoprhism $\Z \simeq \Oo(\Z)^\op$ a perversity over $\mathbb{Z}$ is just a \textit{monotone and comonotope perversity} in the sense of {\color{red} referenza, tipo bezrukavnikov o BBD}. 
\end{rem}
%\begin{prop}\label{pipp}
%Let $J \overset{f}{\longrightarrow} J'$ be a a $\mathbb{Z}$-equivariant map (not necessarily increasing) between $\mathbb{Z}$-posets, $\mathscr{P}$ a $J$-slicing on $\mathscr{D}$. Suppose that $\mathscr{P}_{\psi} \subseteq \mathscr{P}_{\phi}^{\perp}$ whenever one of the following conditions holds: 
%\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
%\item $f(\phi) > f(\psi)$
%\item $f(\phi) + 1 > f(\psi)$ and $\phi +1 < \psi$
%\end{enumerate}
%Then $$(f_{\textnormal{\Libra}}(\mathscr{P}))_{\phi}=\mathscr{P}_{f^{-1}(\phi)}$$
%defines a $J'$-slicing on $\mathscr{D}$.
%\end{prop}
%
%\begin{proof}
%Part \textit{(1)} of definition of slicing follows from $\mathbb{Z}$-equivariance of $f$, while part \textit{(2)} follows from condition \textit{(a)} above. Pick $0 \not = X \in \mathscr{D}$ and consider its Postnikov tower with respect to $\mathscr{P}$: $$0=Y_0 \overset{\beta_1}{\longrightarrow} \cdots \overset{\beta_n}{\longrightarrow} Y_n=X$$
%with $\textnormal{cone}(\beta_i)=H_{\mathscr{P}}^{\phi_i}(X)$. Going from left to right, if we encounter an $i$ so that $f(\phi_{i+1}) > f(\phi_i)$ then by condition \textit{(b)} $$\textnormal{Hom}_{\mathscr{D}}(H_{\mathscr{P}}^{\phi_{i+1}}(X),H_{\mathscr{P}}^{\phi_i}(X)[1])=0$$
%
%Using \hyperref[g]{\textbf{Proposition \ref*{g}}} and the \hyperref[s]{\textbf{$3 \times 3$ Lemma}}, we can complete the identity of $Y_i$ to get a diagram: 
%\begin{center}
%\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
%H_{\mathscr{P}}^{\phi_{i+1}}(X)[-1] \arrow{r} \arrow{d} \& Y_i \arrow{r} \arrow{d}{1} \& Y_{i+1} \arrow{r} \arrow{d} \& H_{\mathscr{P}}^{\phi_{i+1}}(X)[1]\arrow{d} \\
%Y_{i-1} \arrow{d} \arrow{r} \& Y_i \arrow{r} \arrow{d} \& H_{\mathscr{P}}^{\phi_i}(X) \arrow{r} \arrow{d} \& Y_{i-1}[1] \arrow{d} \\
%A \arrow{r} \arrow{d} \& 0 \arrow{r} \arrow{d} \& A[1] \arrow{r} \arrow{d} \& A[1] \arrow{d}  \\
%H_{\mathscr{P}}^{\phi_{i+1}}(X) \arrow{r}  \&  Y_i[1] \arrow{r} \& Y_{i+1}[1] \arrow{r} \&  H_{\mathscr{P}}^{\phi_{i+1}}(X)[1]
%\end{tikzcd}
%\end{center}
%
%We then replace $\beta_i$ with $Y_{i-1} \longrightarrow A$ and $\beta_{i+1}$ with $A \longrightarrow Y_{i+1}$. Iterating this process\footnote{This is somehow reminiscent of the 'bubble sort' algorithm.}, we get a factorization $$0=Z_0 \overset{\gamma_1}{\longrightarrow} \cdots \overset{\gamma_n}{\longrightarrow} Z_n=X$$
%with $\textnormal{cone}(\gamma_i)=H_{\mathscr{P}}^{\phi_{k_i}}(X)$ for some $k_i$ and $f(\phi_i) \ge f(\phi_{i+1})$ for all $i$. To get a factorization with the strict latter inequality we use the same argument as in the proof of \hyperref[af]{\textbf{Proposition \ref*{af}}}.
%\end{proof}
%
%The above proof also shows that, in the same hypotheses and notation, $(f_{\textnormal{\Libra}}(\mathscr{P}))_{\phi}$ consists of objects $X \in \mathscr{D}$ so that $H_{\mathscr{P}}^{\psi}(X)=0$ for $ f(\psi) \not = \phi$. Also, \hyperref[aae]{\textbf{Proposition \ref*{aae}}} holds when $f$ is bijective.\\

%\begin{defn}
%A map $\mathbb{Z} \overset{p}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{Z}$ is called \textbf{perversity} if it is a monotone contraction, i.e. if $$0 \le p(\phi) - p(\psi) \le \phi - \psi$$ 
%whenever $\phi \ge \psi$  in $\mathbb{Z}$. \\
%We denote $\Xi$ the set of perversities. 
%\end{defn}
%
%Clearly, $\Xi$ definies a $\mathbb{Z}$-poset which is not totally ordered. However, it is a distributive lattice: we have meets and joins given by: $$(p\land q)(\phi)=\min\{p(\phi), q(\phi) \}$$ $$(p\lor q)(\phi)=\max\{p(\phi), q(\phi) \}$$
%Indeed, if we place on $\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}$ the product order, we have an isomorphism of $\mathbb{Z}$-posets $$\Xi^{\textnormal{op}}=O(\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z})\setminus \{ \emptyset, \mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z} \} $$
%given by sending the zero perversity to $A=\{ (\phi,\psi) \}_{\phi \ge 0} $ and the identity to $B=\{ (\phi,\psi) \}_{\psi \ge 0}$ ($B+i$ and $A+i$ with $i \in \mathbb{Z}$ generate the latter as a complete lattice). Considering the canonical embedding $\mathbb{Z} \hookrightarrow \mathbb{Z}  \subseteq O(\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z})$ we get a sublattice of $\Xi$ depicted as

\begin{prop}\label{grad}
Let $\mathfrak{t}$ be a bounded t-structure on $\mathscr{D}$, $\mathscr{P}$ an abelian $\mathbb{Z}$-slicing on $\heartsuit_{\mathfrak{t}}$, $\mathscr{Q}$ the associated $\mathbb{Z} \ltimes \hat{\mathbb{Z}}$-slicing on $\mathscr{D}$, $p$ a perversity. We have: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item if $\mathscr{P}$ is a perverse filtration, then $\mathscr{Q}$ satisfies the assumptions of \hyperref[pipp]{\textbf{Proposition \ref*{pipp}}} with respect to the map $\mathbb{Z} \ltimes \hat{\mathbb{Z}} \overset{f_p}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{Z} \ltimes \hat{\mathbb{Z}}$ given by $$f_p(n,\phi)=(n+p(\lfloor \phi / 2 \rfloor),-p(\lfloor \phi / 2 \rfloor))$$ 
\item if $\mathscr{P}$ is a grading filtration, then $\mathscr{Q}$ satisfies the assumptions of \hyperref[pipp]{\textbf{Proposition \ref*{pipp}}} with respect to the map $\mathbb{Z} \ltimes \hat{\mathbb{Z}} \overset{g_p}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{Z} \ltimes \hat{\mathbb{Z}}$ given by $$g_p(n,\phi)=(n+p(\phi),-p(\phi))$$ 
\item if $\mathscr{P}$ is a mixed filtration, then the abelian $\mathbb{Z}$-slicing induced on the heart of the bounded t-structure associated to $(g_p)_{\textnormal{\Libra}}(\mathscr{Q})$ is split 
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Let's prove \textit{(2)}. Suppose $g_p(n,\phi) > g_p(m,\psi)$. Then either $m-n< p(\phi) - p(\psi)$ or both $m-n = p(\phi) - p(\psi)$ and $p(\psi) < p(\psi)$. Since by definition of t-structure we can assume $m \ge n$, the second case is absurd while in the first case, since $p$ is monotone, we have $\phi \ge \psi$ and thus by definition of perversity $$m-n<p(\phi)-p(\psi) \le \phi - \psi$$ 
and we get the desired Hom-vanishing by definition of grading filtration. \\

Suppose now $f_p(n,\phi) + 1 > f_p(m,\psi)$ and $(n+1,\phi) < (m,\psi)$. The only non absurd case is $ 1<m-n \le  p(\phi) - p(\psi)$. But then again we have $$2 \le m-n \le p(\phi)-p(\psi) \le \phi - \psi$$
and we can conclude as above. \\

To prove \textit{(1)} consider the monotone map $$\mathbb{Z} \overset{\lfloor * / 2 \rfloor}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{Z}$$
Applying the slice functor to the latter and starting with a perverse filtration, we get a grading filtration by the properties of the floor function and the thesis follows from part \textit{(2)}. \\ 

Let's prove \textit{(3)}. We have to show that $$\mathscr{P}_{\psi}[1-p(\psi)] \subseteq \mathscr{P}_{\phi }[p(\phi)]^{\perp}$$ 
for $-p(\psi)>-p(\phi)$. We denote $n=p(\phi)-p(\psi)-1$. Assuming again $n \ge 0$, we have $n \ge 0 > p(\psi) - p(\phi) \ge \psi - \phi$ and we can then conclude by definition of mixed filtration. 
\end{proof}

Thus, in the presence of a grading (or perverse) filtration on the heart of a bounded t-structure, associating to a perversity $p$ the bounded t-structure coming from $(g_p)_{\textnormal{\Libra}}(\mathscr{Q})$ defines a morphism of $\mathbb{Z}$-posets $$\Xi^{\textnormal{op}} \longrightarrow \mathfrak{bts}(\mathscr{D})$$
we can restate this as: 

\begin{center}
\twonotes \ \textit{A grading or perverse filtration on the heart of a bounded t-structure on $\mathscr{D}$ induces a presheaf of t-structures on $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ with the product order, and thus some kind of a 'non totally ordered $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$-slicing' on $\mathscr{D}$.}

Now, by sending an upper set of $I \in O(\mathbb{Z})$ to its characteristic function $\chi_I$ we get an embedding $$O(\mathbb{Z})^{\textnormal{op}} \hookrightarrow \Xi$$ and the t-structure coming from $(g_{\chi_I})_{\textnormal{\Libra}}(\mathscr{Q})$ is just the tilting of $\mathfrak{t}$ with respect to the torsion pair coming from $I$. \\
The following proposition gives a characterization of the new heart obtained by the above construction. In the case of a mixed filtration, we get a splitting property which is often referred as 'decomposition theorem for perverse sheaves' in literature. \\

\begin{prop}
Let $\mathfrak{t}$ be a bounded t-structure on $\mathscr{D}$, $\mathscr{P}$ a grading filtration on $\heartsuit_{\mathfrak{t}}$, $\mathscr{Q}$ the associated $\mathbb{Z} \ltimes \hat{\mathbb{Z}}$-slicing on $\mathscr{D}$, $p$ a perversity. Denote $\mathfrak{q}$ the bounded t-structure associated to $(g_p)_{\textnormal{\Libra}}(\mathscr{Q})$. Then $\heartsuit_{\mathfrak{q}}$ consists of objects $X \in \mathscr{D}$ so that $$H_{\mathfrak{t}}^{k}(X) \in \mathscr{P}_{p^{-1}(-k)}[k]$$ 
for each $k \in \mathbb{Z}$. Moreover, if $\mathscr{P}$ is a mixed filtration then for each $X \in \heartsuit_{\mathfrak{q}}$ $$X=\bigoplus_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}H_{\mathfrak{t}}^{n}(X)$$ 
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
This is very similar to \hyperref[tilt1]{\textbf{Proposition \ref*{tilt1}}}: we have that $X \in \heartsuit_{\mathfrak{q}}$ if and only if $$H_{\mathscr{P}}^{\phi}(H_{\mathfrak{t}}^k(X)[-k])[k]=H_{\mathscr{Q}}^{(k,\phi)}(X)=0$$ 
for $p(\phi) \not = -k$. \\
For the second part of the claim, the abelian $\mathbb{Z}$-slicing induced on $\heartsuit_{\mathfrak{q}}$ is split by \hyperref[grad]{\textbf{Proposition \ref*{grad}}} and thus by \hyperref[split]{\textbf{Proposition \ref*{split}}} $$X=\bigoplus_{(k,\phi)}H_{\mathscr{Q}}^{(k,\phi)}(X)=\bigoplus_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}H_{\mathfrak{t}}^{n}(X)$$
where the last equality comes from the first part. 
\end{proof}

\begin{exmp}
Let $$B=\bigoplus_{i\in \mathbb{N}}B_i$$ be an $\mathbb{N}$-graded ring with $B_0$ semisimple. Denote $\mathscr{A}$ the category of $\mathbb{Z}$-graded $B$-modules with only finitely many nonzero graded pieces. For $\phi \in \mathbb{Z}$, denote $\mathscr{P}_{\phi}$ the full subcategory of $\mathscr{A}$ of modules concentrated in degree $\phi$. Clearly, $\mathscr{P}$ defines an abelian $\mathbb{Z}$-slicing on $\mathscr{A}$. Following \cite{kos} we have $$\textnormal{Ext}_{\mathscr{A}}^n(\mathscr{P}_{\phi},\mathscr{P}_{\psi})=0$$
for $n>\psi - \phi$. This means that $\mathscr{P}$ is a mixed filtration and the bounded t-structure on $\mathscr{D}^b(\mathscr{A})$ associated to $(g_1)_{\textnormal{\Libra}}(\mathscr{Q})$ (where $1$ is the identity of $\mathbb{Z}$) is the 'diagonal' (or 'geometric') t-structure which appears in Koszul duality and other areas. 
\end{exmp}

\begin{exmp}
Let $M$ be an $n$-dimensional smooth complex projective variety and consider the $n$-torsion pair $\mathscr{P}$ on $\textnormal{Coh}(M)$ from \hyperref[cohh]{\textbf{Example \ref*{cohh}}}. Using Serre duality and the Grothendieck vanishing theorem, one sees that $\mathscr{P}$, seen as an abelian $\mathbb{Z}$-slicing via the inclusion $[n] \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$, is a perverse filtration. The bounded t-structure associated to $(f_p)_{\textnormal{\Libra}}(\mathscr{Q})$ is the one of perverse coherent sheaves as constructed in \cite{bez}. Following again the proof of \hyperref[t]{\textbf{Proposition \ref*{t}}}, we can use the Harder-Narasimhan filtrations from Gieseker stability to obtain an abelian $J_n$-slicing on the heart of perverse coherent sheaves as done in \cite{perpol}. 
\end{exmp}

%
%Now we somehow review the gluing construction for t-structures in \cite{del}, but generalize it to any slicing. Our language is quite different though, and we formulate the problem very similarly to \cite{glu}. We start with two $\mathbb{Z}$-posets $J,J'$. 
%
%\begin{defn}
%Let $\mathscr{P}$ be a $J \ltimes J'$-slicing on $\mathscr{D}$. We call $\mathscr{P}$ \textbf{gluable} if it satisties the assumptions of \hyperref[pipp]{\textbf{Proposition \ref*{pipp}}} with respect to the map $J \ltimes J' \overset{e}{\longrightarrow} J' \ltimes J$ that exchanges coordinates. In this case we denote $$\overline{\mathscr{P}}=e_{\textnormal{\Libra}}(\mathscr{P})$$
%\end{defn}
%
%By a simple computation, the gluability condition reads: $\mathscr{P}_{(\phi,\psi)} \subseteq \mathscr{P}_{(\phi',\psi')}^{\perp}$ if $\psi' > \psi$ or both $\psi'+1>\psi$ and $\phi'+1 < \phi$. For example, the first condition is automatic when $\mathbb{Z}$ acts trivially on $J$ (in this case, it follows from the second one). In particular, if $\mathbb{Z}$ acts trivially on $J$, $\mathscr{P}$ is a $J$-slicing on $\mathscr{D}$ and $\mathfrak{t}_{\phi}$ is a bounded t-structure on $\mathscr{P}_{\phi}$ for each $\phi \in J$, then using \hyperref[aab]{\textbf{Proposition \ref*{aab}}} we get a $J \ltimes \mathbb{Z}$-slicing $\mathscr{Q}$ which is gluable if and only if $$\heartsuit_{\mathfrak{t}_{\psi}}[n] \subseteq \heartsuit_{\mathfrak{t}_{\phi}}^{\perp}$$
%whenever both $n \le 0$ and $\phi < \psi$. 
%
%\begin{rem}
%We have a commutative diagram of $\mathbb{Z}$-posets 
%\begin{center}
%\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
%\mathbb{Z} \ltimes \mathbb{Z} \arrow{r}{\sim} \arrow{d}{e} \& \mathbb{Z} \ltimes \hat{\mathbb{Z}} \arrow{d}{g} \\
%\mathbb{Z} \ltimes \mathbb{Z} \arrow{r}{\sim}  \& \mathbb{Z} \ltimes \hat{\mathbb{Z}} 
%\end{tikzcd}
%\end{center}
%where the horizontal isomorphism is the one from \hyperref[zet]{\textbf{Remark \ref*{zet}}}. Indeed, a $\mathbb{Z} \ltimes \mathbb{Z}$-slicing on $\mathscr{D}$ is gluable if and only if it induces a grading filtration on the heart of the associated t-structure when seen as a $\mathbb{Z} \ltimes \hat{\mathbb{Z}}$-slicing. 
%\end{rem} 
%
%An easy combinatorial calculation finally yelds the following two remarks: 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item  if $\mathscr{P}$ is a gluable $\hat{\mathbb{Z}} \ltimes \mathbb{Z}$-slicing on $\mathscr{D}$, then $\overline{\mathscr{P}}$ induces a grading filtration on the associated heart, allowing us again to construct new bounded t-structures depending on a perversity. 
%\item if $\mathscr{P}$ is a mixed filtration on the heart of a bounded t-structure and $\mathscr{Q}$ is the associated $\mathbb{Z} \ltimes \hat{\mathbb{Z}}$-slicing on $\mathscr{D}$, then $\mathscr{Q}$ is gluable. In this case, looking at $\overline{\mathscr{Q}}$, we get a baric structure on $\mathscr{D}$ which is usually called \textbf{weight decomposition} in literature. 
%\end{itemize}
%In other words, the chain of implications for a $\mathbb{Z} \ltimes \hat{\mathbb{Z}}$-slicing refines to 
%$$\textnormal{mixed} \implies \textnormal{gluable} \implies \textnormal{grading} \implies \textnormal{perverse} $$
%
%%\begin{prop}
%%A $J \ltimes J'$-slicing $\mathscr{P}$ on $\mathscr{D}$ is gluable if and only if it satifies the assumptions of \hyperref[pipp]{\textbf{Proposition \ref*{pipp}}} with respect to the identity (as sets) $J \ltimes J' \longrightarrow J \times J'$, where we place the product order on the right member. 
%%\end{prop}
%%
%%\begin{proof}
% % Consider the following commutative diagram of sets
% % \begin{center}
%%\begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&]
%%J \ltimes J' \arrow{r}{e} \arrow{d}{1} \& J \ltimes J' \\
%%J \times J' \arrow{r}{e}  \& J \times J' \arrow{u}{1}
%%\end{tikzcd}
%%  \end{center}
%%  The right arrow is a morphism of $\mathbb{Z}$-posets while the down one is an isomorphism of $\mathbb{Z}$-posets, and the thesis follows. 
%%\end{proof}
%%\begin{prop}
%%Let $\mathscr{P}$ be a gluable $J \times J'$-slicing on $\mathscr{D}$. For $i = 1,2$, denote $\mathscr{P}^i=\pi_{\textnormal{\Libra}}^i(\mathscr{P})$, where $J \overset{\pi^1}{\longleftarrow} J \times J' \overset{\pi^2}{\longrightarrow} J'$ are the projections. Then for each $\psi \in J'$, $\mathscr{P}_{\psi}^2$ consists of objects $X \in \mathscr{D}$ so that $$H_{\mathscr{P}^1}^{\phi}(X) \in \mathscr{Q}_{(\phi,\psi)}$$
%%for each $\phi \in J$.
%%\end{prop}
%%
%%\begin{proof}
%%We have already seen that $X \in \mathscr{P}_{\psi}^2$ if and only if $$H_{\mathscr{P}}^{\lambda}(X)=H_{\mathscr{P}}^{\lambda}(H_{\mathscr{P}^1}^{\pi^1(\lambda)}(X))=0$$
%%for $\pi^2(\lambda) \not =\psi$. By fixing $\pi^1(\lambda)=\phi$ and varying $\pi^2(\lambda)$, we get the desired result.
